# Very-Kerbal-Kontroller
A custom control panel for Kerbal Space Program

This repository is a place for me to keep and share my code, designs and data for my custom KSP Control Panel.

The contents are:

1. Arduino Code - The modules that run on the Arduino Mega 2560
2. Documentation - Design document (still to be done), schematics (TinyCad and PDF) and general design stuff
3. Panel Graphics - The printed graphics used on the panels. Open Office Draw and MS Word formats
4. Python Code - The python module that runs at the PC end of the link

Although this stuff is all specific to my build it should be pretty easy to adapt to any other applications. If it helps you then please use it. If it doesnt make sense, ask as i probably screwed up. 

Note: The python code is very WIP and I am NOT a python expert, or even moderately knowledgable. It works, but i dont always know how. Clean ups will follow.
